### Notes

- add page 3-7 code  
  _The Book version of the Guitar class search() function didn't actually return anything except null. So, even if a guitar was found, the code had a bug where it would only return null._
  
  _This version won't find any matches since Erin didn't capitalize "fender"_

- add page 14-18 code  
  _This version adds in the enumerated types to replace some of the strings. This time, a guitar with Erin's criteria was found, but only a single guitar when multiple guitars matched._

  _To save some typing the enum classes were copied from the gitlab since the full enum was not provided in the book._
