# Making Games with Python & Pygame

This folder contains content related to the book [**Making Games with Python & Pygame**](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/)

_There is some refactoring from the book since much of the code was just typed 
in unstead of pasted. When code was pasted, some variables names were renamed.
To get things like the asset loading to work, you need to run the program from
the book's root folder._

_Some other minor changes might occur here and there, so beware._

_The book just throws everything into one folder. So, to avoid tons of fixing
code, I used the same technique. This is sloppy, but it's an older, simple book
after all targeted towards younger programmers I imagine..._
