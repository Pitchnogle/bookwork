# Exercise 16 - Reading and Writing Files

_Previously, we opened the file without any other arguments. It defaults to 'r' for read
if no other arguments are given._

```py
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

print(f"We're going to erase {filename}.")
print("If you don't want that, hit Ctrl-C (^C).")
print("If you do want that, hit RETURN.")

input("?")

print("Opening the file...")
target = open(filename, 'w')

print("Truncating the file. Goodbye!")
target.truncate()

print("Now I'm going to ask you for three lines.")

line1 = input("line1: ")
line2 = input("line2: ")
line3 = input("line3: ")

print("I'm going to write these to the file.")

target.write(line1)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line2)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line3)
target.write("\n")

print("And finally, we close it.")
target.close()
```

```
$ python3 ex16.py test.txt
We're going to erase test.txt.
If you don't want that, hit Ctrl-C (^C).
If you do want that, hit RETURN.
?
Opening the file...
Truncating the file. Goodbye!
Now I'm going to ask you for three lines.
line1: This is the first line of text. Not much going on here.
line2: This sentence thinks the first line was...unimaginative.
line3: This line concludes the exercise. See ya!
I'm going to write these to the file.
And finally, we close it.

$ cat test.txt 
This is the first line of text. Not much going on here.
This sentence thinks the first line was...unimaginative.
This line concludes the exercise. See ya!
