You'd need to know 'bout escapes with \ that do:

 newlines and    tabs.

        The lovely world

 the needs of love

        where there is none.

--------------------
This should be five: 5
With a start point of: 10000
We'd have 5000000 beans, 5000.0 jars, and 50.0 crates.
We can also do that this way:
We'd have 500000.0 beans, 500.0 jars, and 5.0 crates.
