# Exercise 3 - Numbers and Math

```py

print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)
print("Now I will count the eggs:")
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)
print('What is 3 + 2?', 3 + 2)
print('What is 5 - 7?', 5 - 7)
print("That's why it's false")
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
print("Is it greater than or equal?", 5 >= -2)
print("Is is less than or equal?", 5 <= -2)
```

```
$ python3 ex03.py
I will now count my chickens:
Hens 30.0
Roosters 97
Now I will count the eggs:
6.75
Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?
False
What is 3 + 2? 5
What is 5 - 7? -2
That's why it's false
Is it greater? True
Is it greater than or equal? True
Is is less than or equal? False
