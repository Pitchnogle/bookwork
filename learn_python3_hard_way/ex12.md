# Exercise 12 - Prompting People

`This is a reimplementation of exercise 11 demonstrating another way to prompt for user input.`

```py
age = input('How old are you? ')
height = input('How tall are you? ')
weight = input('How much do you weigh? ')

print(f"So, you're {age} years old, {height} tall and {weight} lbs heavy")
```

```
$ python3 ex12.py
How old are you? 35
How tall are you? 6'2"
How much do you weigh? 170
So you're 35 years old, 6'2" tall and 170 lbs heavy
```
