# Exercise 2 - Comments and Pound Characters

```py
# This is outside scope of book but need to determine version for sanity
import sys
print(sys.version)

# Single line comments are started with the '#' character
# Anything after the # is ignored
print("This is printed") # print("This is ignored")

# You can also use comments to disable code
# print("This won't run")

print('This will run')

'''
You can also comment out mutiple lines using three single quotes. This example 
uses single quotes. In colab, the multiline comments are colorized differently 
than when using the # type comments

print("Will the next comment block print?")
