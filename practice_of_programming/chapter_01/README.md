# Notes

1. **Names**  
  - _Use descriptive names for globals, short names for locals_
  - _Be consistent_  
  Give related things related names that show their relationship and highlight their differences.
  - _Use active names for functions_
  - _Be accurate_  
  A name not only labels, it conveys information to the reader. A misleading name can result in mystifying bugs.
2. **Expressions and Statements**  
  - _Indent to show structure_
  - _Use the natural form for expressions_  
  Negative logic is hard to understand. Attempt to rewrite to use positive logic.
  - _Parenthesize to resolve ambiguity_
  - _Break up complex expressions_
  - _Be clear, not clever_
  - _Be careful with side-effects_
3. **Consistency and Idioms**  
  - _Use a consistent indentation and brace style_
  - _Use idioms for consistency_
  - _Use else-if's for multi-way decisions_
4. **Function Macros**  
  - _Avoid function macros_
  - _Parenthesize the macro body and arguments_
5. **Magic Numbers**  
  - _Give names to magic numbers_
  - _Define numbers and constants, not macros_  
  When possible. For arrays in C this is advice is not always practical
  - _Use character constants, not integers_
  - _Use the language to calculate the size of an object_
6. **Comments**  
  - _Don't belabor the obvious_
  - _Comment functions and global data_
  - _Don't comment bad code, rewrite it_
  - _Don't contradict the code_
  - _Clarify, don't confuse_
