# Head First Python

This folder contains content related to the book [**Head First Python**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-python/9781449397524/) from O'Reilly.

Some of the chapters used jupyter notebook; I probably started and restarted the
book a few times. Later reads just used python3 interactively on the command
line. Both cover the same stuff.
