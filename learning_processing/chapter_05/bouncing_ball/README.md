This a simple ball-bouncing physics simulation. The ball starts of in (0,0) and then follows a bouncing parabolic trajectory. The ball will change directions off all walls. When the user clicks the mouse button, the ball will "hit" upwards somewhat. The top and sides will merely change the direction. When the ball hits the bottom, there is some dampening effect so the ball will eventually just roll.
